## Setup and customization

You will find a working solar system generation in the SampleScene. Every customizable option is seen in the "SolarSystemGenerator" component of the SolarSystem GameObject.

## Goals
Current goals of this project and their status:
  ### Done
   * Random generation of a solar system with planets and planet satellites
   * Planet rotation around the center star of their solar system based on their distance to it
   * Rotation of planets around their axis based on their day circle
   * Satellite rotation around their parent planet
   * Rotation of satellite around their axis
   * Random Name Generation for stars, planets and satellites

  ### Doing
   * Better random destribution of planets in the solar system
   * Random size of stars, planets and satellites based on the distance to their star
   * GUI
  ### Todo
   * Generation of galaxies
   * Seemless transition from galaxy map to a solar system when clicked

## Future
Currently this is just for fun and exploring the topic of random generation. I might come back to it later with ideas to make it a full fletched game
