# Galaxy-Generator

Random galaxy, solar system and planet generation in Untiy3D Version 2019.3. 

## Setup and customization

As of now, you wont find working UI elements as I started to use a paid asset for these, so there will be missing imgages.

You will find a working galaxy generation in the SampleScene. Every customizable option is seen in the ```GalaxyGenerator``` component of the galaxy gameObject.
To customize planets, satellites and solar systems, please refer to their corresponding prefab in the Prefabs folder.

## Features 
Current features of this project
  ### Done
   * Random generation of a solar system with planets and planet satellites
   * Planet rotation around the center star of their solar system based on their distance to it
   * Rotation of planets around their axis based on their day circle
   * Satellite rotation around their parent planet
   * Rotation of satellite around their axis
   * Random Name Generation for stars, planets and satellites
   * Random galaxy generation
   * Connecting paths between near solar systems in a galaxy
   * Color of stars is connected to their heat


## Future
Currently this is just for fun and exploring the topic of random generation. I might come back to it later with ideas to make it a full fletched game
